<p><strong>finalspeed</strong> is a good program to improve performance of TCP. This is the  <a href="https://github.com/d1sm/finalspeed/" title="Title"> origin Github page</a>. I did not clone or fork the project ruslt origin source could not be shown. It's a pity that he author deleted all useful code to promte his new project <a href="http://www.xsocks.me/" title="Title">Xsocks</a>. Frankly I do not <strong>trust</strong> any project close-source although I did not have code of finalspeed. Anyhow, it <strong>was</strong> a open-source project </p>
